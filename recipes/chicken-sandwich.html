            <li>4 leaves of lettuce</li>
                
            <li>4 slices tomato</li>
                
            <li>Â½ cup thinly sliced onions</li>
                
            <li>12 slices dill pickle</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate with cooking spray.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crispy, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                
            <li>While the bacon is cooking, rub poultry seasoning onto chicken.</li>
                
            <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
                Top each chicken breast with 2 slices bacon and 1 slice pepper Jack cheese; close the lid and cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                
            <li>Remove chicken from the grill and place on buns. Top with lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickle slices.</li>
          </ol>
